This repository is the home of all the personal websites that I host. As of November 2023, it hosts 3 websites. The first is a interactive website that holds a number of sentimal text messages between my girlfriend and me which I created for our first anniversary. The second is another interactive website that allows me to change the LED status of a heart PCB I created for my second anniversary. The last is my portfolio of assorted accomplishments, projects, and achievements to be used for job applications.
